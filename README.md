Building a portfolio Website for team Atoms:  

Division of sections and tasks:  
  
  We divided the sections of our section in 4. All the sections have to be accessible to everyone (watch out for the color contrast, tab indexes) and responsive on a website   and on a Mobile/tablets device.  
  
   * **Heading**: This one had to have a navigation bar, that could allow everyone to navigate through our website. 
     in the heading, there should be a secondheadline.  
     
   * **About** section: Our description: what team atoms do, what we offer.
    
   * **Team** section: Who we are, our job title and inline links to our github, linkedin and codewars sites.  
   
   * **Form** section: Creation of a form where people could contact our company. The form should contain: the name, the email    and the message of the person that wants to contact us.
