## Team Atoms!

### What we do, who we are, and how to contact us?

#### What do we do?

 Team Atoms was funded in 14 Palmers Road after the current 4 CEO members decided to build a company that will be able to merge design, responsiveness, accessibility when building websites for client.  
 We do not only create original website designs, we made them accessible to everyone and to every single device. Why should we be able to see in our desktop what we see in our phone and viceversa?  
 
 Atoms can't be divided, and that explains our name: we built websites that can join everyone and not divide them!.  
 
 #### What can we offer you?
 
 Our team of frontend and backend developpers will make sure your website is fully personalized, making it attractive to everyone!

#### Who we are?

A team od 4 friends met one day in Palmers Road to discuss how all the problems they encountered in their long career could be solved. And boom ATOMS was created. We believe as ATOMS, that our different set of skills make us strong and indivisible!
